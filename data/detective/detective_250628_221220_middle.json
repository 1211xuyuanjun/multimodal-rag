These methodologies typically lead to performance bottlenecks and unsatisfactory generalizability. Consequently, these methods are often inapplicable for out- of- distribution (OOD) data and newly emerged large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we revisit the task of AI- generated text detection. We argue that the key to accomplishing this task lies in distinguishing writing styles of different authors, rather than simply classifying the text into human- written or AI- generated text. To this end, we propose DeTeCtive, a multi- task auxiliary, multi- level contrastive learning framework. DeTeCtive is designed to facilitate the learning of distinct writing styles, combined with a dense information retrieval pipeline for AI- generated text detection. Our method is compatible with a range of text encoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the ability of various text encoders in detecting AI- generated text across multiple benchmarks and achieves state- of- the- art results. Notably, in OOD zero- shot evaluation, our method outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Moreover, we find our method boasts a Training- Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA) capability towards OOD data, further enhancing its efficacy in OOD detection scenarios. We will open- source our code and models in hopes that our work will spark new thoughts in the field of AI- generated text detection, ensuring safe application of LLMs and enhancing compliance."

Individual authors invariably exhibit unique writing styles, collectively constituting a vast feature space of writing styles. Our key insight is that an LLM can be viewed as a specific author, with the text it generates conforming consistently to its unique style. In line with this key observation, we propose to reformulate AI- generated text detection as a task of distinguishing diverse writing styles within the feature space, rather than merely treating it as a binary classification problem between human- written and AI- generated. This reformulation presents a fresh perspective from which to approach the detection of AI- generated text."

Our method enhances the writing- style encoding capabilities of various models, including but not limited to BERT- based [18] and T5- based [51] models. This framework is capable of calibrating the distances between samples sharing different degrees of relatedness, thereby encoding distinctive features of text generated by different authors (either humans or LLMs). During inference, we propose a pipeline anchored by dense information retrieval [58, 66]. Firstly, we pre- encode data drawn from the training dataset, extract features and store them within a feature database. Then, for any given query text, we simply calculate the similarity between its encoded feature and each feature vector nestled in the feature database. This measure is used to evaluate the degree of writing- style similarity. Finally, we employ the K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [15] algorithm for classification prediction."

                                    "content": "AI- generated text detection. Existing methods for AI- generated text detection generally fall into the following three categories: (i) Watermarking methods: watermarking methods, which include rule based [5, 30, 59] and deep learning based [17, 62] methods, involve embedding specific markers into AI- generated content, which can later be used to verify its source. The soft watermarking method [32] is an inference- time framework that involves grouping the vocabulary and decoding the next token preferentially. [23] proposes a method of adding watermarks by embedding backdoors triggered by special inputs into the model. UPV [41] is an unforgeable and publicly verifiable algorithm ensuring security against forgery and unauthorized detection attempts. (ii) Statistical methods: applying statistical metrics like entropy as thresholds to distinguish AI- generated text from human- written text. HowKGPT [63] identifies text origins by comparing perplexity scores of human- written and ChatGPT [6, 69] generated text. DetectGPT [47] utilizes the structural properties of the LLM's probability density for zero- shot detection of AI- generated text. Similarly, DetectLLM [56] employs normalized perturbation log- ranks for identification, exhibiting less sensitivity to perturbations. (iii) Supervised learning methods: GPT- Sentinel [11] incorporates a binary classifier into RobBERTa [43] and T5 [51], which are directly trained on specific datasets. RADAR [27] employs an adversarial learning approach. By continually iterating to improve the detector and generator (both of which are LLMs), RADAR performs well in detecting both original and paraphrased AI- generated text. [55] utilizes contrastive learning to learn style representations on human- written text and uses the learned representations to identify different sources in a few- shot manner. Building on SCL [24] framework, CoCo [42] incorporates coherency information into the text representation, enhancing the ability to detect AI- generated text under resource- constrained conditions."

The success of MoCo [25] and SimCLR [9] in the field of Computer Vision through contrastive learning has prompted research efforts to explore its potential in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), resulting in the development of various strategies to enhance text encoding capabilities via contrastive learning. IS- BERT [78] employs the DIM [26] framework to learn text representations. The ArcCon loss [80] is proposed to further enhance the model's semantic discriminating ability. MixCSE [79] introduces an unsupervised method for text representation learning, which incorporates a mixed negative sample strategy to boost the model's ability to discriminate complex semantics. VaSCL [75] adopts a more general approach to procure hard negatives by defining an instance- level contrastive loss and integrating Gaussian noise, it effectively enhances the model's performance in an unsupervised manner. DCLR [82] addresses the anisotropic problem brought about by negative samples in unsupervised sentence representation learning by introducing noise- based negative samples and virtual adversarial training, thereby improving the uniformity of the representation space. SimCSE [21] proposes to predict the input sentence itself, utilizing standard dropout as noise in an unsupervised manner. They also introduce a method for categorizing positive and hard negative sample pairs, thereby improving the sentence representations."

In Section 3.2, we explore the design of the multi- task auxiliary multi- level contrastive learning, which are critical components of our framework. Finally, in Section 3.3, we introduce Training- Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA), an efficient and effective strategy that leverages our method's generalization capability to handle out- of- distribution (OOD) data."

Ultimately, this task is reduced to a binary classification problem. While this formulation appears simple and straightforward, it neglects a vital factor. Analogous to how different novelists often demonstrate unique writing styles, it's critical to consider that different LLMs, due to variations in model architectures, training data and strategies, will inevitably infuse certain preferences and biases. Consequently, these variations induce stylistic differences. Therefore, categorizing all the texts generated by any LLM as the same category clearly overlooks these disparities."

As discussed in Section 3.1, the distinctive writing styles attributed to different authors constitute a vast feature space. We perceive each LLM as an individual author. Consequently, AI- generated text detection evolves into a task of differentiating diverse writing styles within this feature space. Driven by this insight, it becomes critical to discern the similarities and discrepancies across varying writing styles. To effectuate this, we carefully devise a multi- task auxiliary, multi- level contrastive loss to facilitate the learning of fine- grained features."

We consider the positive sample similarity as the average value related to the entire set of positive samples from the current sample's perspective. The handling of negative samples echoes that of SimCLR, rendering the contrastive learning loss as demonstrated in Eq. 6, where "

Existing AI- generated text detection solutions, which typically treat the task as a binary classification problem [11, 24], encounter difficulties in generalizing to new models and domains that yield out- of- distribution (OOD) data. When confronted with OOD data, these approaches commonly require retraining the model, a strategy that undeniably falls short of practicality in real- world applications. In light of this challenge, we propose a novel solution based on our existing framework — the Training- Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA). This method allows our model to adapt to new domains or newly emerged LLMs without any further training. Specifically, When encountering OOD data not covered in the training set, we simply encode these data using our fine- tuned text encoder and incorporate the encoded features into the existing feature database "

The Deepfake [39] dataset includes text generated by 27 different LLMs and human- written content from multiple websites across 10 domains, encompassing 332K training and 57K test data. It also outlines six diverse testing scenarios, covering an array of settings from domain- specific to cross- domains, and out- of- distribution detection scenarios. The M4 [67] dataset is a multi- domain, multi- model, and multi- language dataset encompassing data from 8 LLMs, 6 domains, and 9 languages. With machine text in its testing data paraphrased by OUTFOX [33], which introduces more complexity to the task. We perform experiments in both monolingual and multilingual settings, with the former containing 120K training and 34K testing data, and the latter comprising 157K training and 42K testing data. Finally, we make use of the TuringBench [61] dataset. TuringBench collects human- written text mainly from news titles and content, predominantly"

AvgRec, the average of recall for human- written (HumanRec) and AI- generated (MachineRec) text. Simple accuracy is inadequate for reflecting a model's performance on a minority class, especially in cases of data imbalance. The F1- score considers both the precision and recall of the model, evaluating overall model performance by computing the harmonic mean of these two. Together, these metrics present a comprehensive view of the effectiveness in detecting AI- generated text."

In all subsequent experiments, for comparison analysis, we utilize the pre- trained SimCSE- RoBERTa [21] model as our text encoder. We conduct comparisons with several training- based methods across all three datasets. These incorporate methods which train classifiers upon RoBERTa [43] and Longformer [2] models, the T5- Sentinel [10] method that classifies using the output probability of the T5 [51] model, and the SCL [42] approach that uses supervised contrastive learning to assist classification.

We train for 50 epochs with batch size of 32 per GPU on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. During inference, we implement with an efficient K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [13] algorithm provided by the Faiss [46] library, to perform classification.

The experiments are divided into three scenarios: Non- attacked, DIPPER [35] attack, and OUTFOX attack, the results are presented in Table 3. From the experimental results, it can be seen that our method achieves the best results under all three settings, and the performance of our method does not decline much after being attacked, whereas the performance of other methods declines significantly. The analysis is as follows, we believe that our usage of the K- Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm for classification offers our approach with a level of fault tolerance. Thus, minor disturbances prompted by certain attacks do not engender significant feature drift. Consequently, our method remains effective in detection. Therefore, these experiments show that our method has good robustness against paraphrasing attack."

To further verify our method's capability to differentiate various writing styles, we apply UMAP [45] for dimensionality reduction on text embeddings from the test set of the Deepfake Cross- domains & Cross- models subset. As shown in Figure 3 (a), using a pre- trained model directly fails to segregate embeddings of varying categories. In contrast, after fine- tuning with our method, UMAP unsupervised dimensionality reduction is already capable of clustering the features of various categories well, as shown in Figure 3 (b). With UMAP supervised dimensionality reduction, as shown in Figure 3 (c) and (d), our model further reflects the multi- level relations either between model families or individual models."

Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates state- of- the- art performance on three popular benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of each component via ablation studies. We also uncover our method's Training- Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA) capability, enriching its experimental analysis. We hope our work brings new insights and findings for the task of AI- generated text detection."
